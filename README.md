# Netcord. Freely connected, finally.
Netcord is a Discord bot for seamless 24/7 cross-server chatting. Think of it as a userphone that runs 24/7.
We will also add chatting between multiple platforms later on.

You can also host your own Netcord instance (guide on the wiki coming soon)

**Note: The bot is currently in a WIP state. If there are any bugs/issues please report on the support server: https://discord.gg/Td3NqqQbPX**
